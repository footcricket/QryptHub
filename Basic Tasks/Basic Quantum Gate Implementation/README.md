# Basic Quantum Gate Implementation

This repository contains a basic quantum circuit implemented using Qiskit, a quantum computing library in Python. The quantum circuit demonstrates the application of fundamental quantum gates and includes a simulation for measurement results.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install qiskit
    ```

2. Run the quantum circuit simulation:

    ```bash
    python "Basic Quantum Gate Implementation.py"
    ```

    This will execute the provided Qiskit code, simulate the quantum circuit, and display measurement results.

## Results

The simulation results will be displayed, showing the counts of each measurement outcome.
