# Bell’s State Creation- Entanglement Creation

This repository contains a simple quantum circuit implemented using Qiskit, a quantum computing library in Python. The circuit applies a Hadamard gate to the first qubit and a CNOT gate with the first qubit as the control and the second qubit as the target. The measurement results are then simulated, and the counts for each outcome are displayed.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install qiskit
    ```

2. Run the quantum circuit simulation:

    ```bash
    python "Bell’s state creation- Entanglement Creation.py"
    ```

    This will execute the provided Qiskit code, simulate the quantum circuit, and display measurement results.

## Results

The simulation results will be displayed, showing the counts of each measurement outcome.
