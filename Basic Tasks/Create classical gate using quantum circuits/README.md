# Creating Classical Gate Using Quantum Circuits

This repository contains a quantum circuit implemented using Qiskit, a quantum computing library in Python. The circuit simulates a Toffoli gate, a controlled-controlled-X gate, to mimic the behavior of a classical AND gate.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install qiskit
    ```

2. Run the quantum circuit simulation:

    ```bash
    python "Create classical gate using quantum circuits.py"
    ```

    This will execute the provided Qiskit code, simulate the quantum circuit, and display measurement results.

## Circuit Description

- The circuit consists of 3 qubits (2 for input and 1 for output) and 3 classical bits for measurement results.
- A Toffoli gate (controlled-controlled-X) is applied to simulate the behavior of a classical AND gate.
- The output qubit is measured, and the result is stored in the classical bit.

## Results

The simulation results will be displayed, showing the counts of each measurement outcome. In this example, the expected result is {'000'}, representing the output of the AND gate.
